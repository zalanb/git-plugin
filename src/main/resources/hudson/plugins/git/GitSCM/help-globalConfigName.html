<div>
  <p>If given, "git config user.name [this]" is called before builds. This can be overridden by individual projects.</p>
  <p>
    Optionally, the $userName macro can be used, in which case it will be substituted with the full name of the 
    authenticated user that started the build. Naturally, this only works if the user is logged in and the build was
    started manually.
