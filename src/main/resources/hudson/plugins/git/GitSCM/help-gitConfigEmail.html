  <p>If given, "git config user.email [this]" is called before builds. This overrides whatever is in the global settings.</p>
  <p>
    Optionally, the $userId macro can be used, in which case it will be substituted with the user identity of the 
    authenticated user that started the build. Naturally, this only works if the user is logged in and the build was
    started manually.
